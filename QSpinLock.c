// Waiman Long <waiman.long@hp.com>, qspinlock: Introducing a 4-byte queue spinlock implementation,
// https://lwn.net/Articles/561775
//
// This qspinlock is kernel specific. First, the MCS nodes are not actually on-stack, but reside in a static global 2D
// array indexed by CPUID and trap level.  There are 4 trap levels : normal; device interrupt; panic and NMI.  The
// latter 2 are almost never used.  Ignoring the trap levels and assuming a flat 1D array of MCS nodes indexed by the
// CPUID, the only time a thread needs to use its MCS node is for waiting.  A thread might hold lots of spin locks but
// it can only wait on at most one at a time, so having one MCS node per CPU suffices.  Relatedly, to acquire a
// qspinlock preemption must be disabled - scheduler+timer interrupts are disabled.  And code in a qspinlock critical
// section is not allowed to perform a voluntary context switch.  Those are all hard and fixed rules.  So while a thread
// is spinning or holds a qspinlock, the kernel can not switch to another thread, and the thread:CPU relation is stable
// for that period.  Thus, having one MCS node per CPU, while seemingly very odd, is OK in this particular use case.
//
// Also, for historical and legacy reasons (32-bit era, with migration from test-and-set and ticket locks, both of which
// are small) the qspinlock_t size needed to be 32-bits, even on a 64-bit system.  There are lots of structures that are
// tightly packed and cache aligned and would double in size if qspinlock_t was switched from 32-bits to 64-bits.  The
// page_t structure, for instance, consumes one cache line for each 4K page on an x86 system.  It is a non-trivial "tax"
// on physical memory to keep the page_t structures.  On x86, the lose is 1.5% of all _physical memory to the page_t
// array.  The page_t structure is already filled with strange encodings and bit packing tracks to keep the size one
// cache line.  And it contains 3 qspinlock_t fields.  There are many other examples, but the page_t one is compelling.
// Anyway, to keep qspinlock_t at 32-bits, instead of containing a pointer to a tail element, it contains the CPUID
// index of the tail element in the MCS node array.

//
// The Linux qspinlock construct [11, 12, 31] is a compact 32-bit lock, even on 64-bit architectures. The low-order bits
// of the lock word constitute a simple test-and-set lock while the upper bits encode the tail of an MCS chain. The
// result is a hybrid of MCS and test-and-set. In order to fit into a 32-bit work - a critical requirement - the chain
// is formed by logical CPU identifiers instead of traditional MCS queue node pointers. Arriving threads attempt to
// acquire the test-and-set lock embedded in the low order bits of the lock word. This attempt fails if the test-and-set
// lock is held or of the MCS chain is populated. If successful, they enter the critical section, otherwise they join
// the MCS chain embedded in the upper bits of the lock word. When a thread becomes an owner of the MCS lock, it can
// wait for the test-and-set lock to become clear, at which point it claims the test-and-set lock, releases the MCS
// lock, and then enters the critical section. The MCS aspect of qspinlock is used only when there is contention. The
// unlock operator simply clears the test-and-set lock. The MCS lock is never held over the critical section, but only
// during contended acquisition. Only the owner of the MCS lock spins on the test-and-set lock, reducing coherence
// traffic. Qspinlock is strictly FIFO. While the technique employs local spinning on the MCS chain, unlike traditional
// MCS, arriving and departing threads will both update the common lock word, increasing coherence traffic and degrading
// performance relative to classic MCS. Qspinlock incorporates an additional optimization where the first contending
// thread spins on the test-and-set lock instead of using the MCS path. Traditional MCS does not fit well in the Linux
// kernel as (a) the constraint that a low-level spin lock instance be only 32-bits is a firm requirement, and (b) the
// lock-unlock API does not provide a convenient way to pass the owner's MCS queue node address from lock to unlock. We
// note that qspinlocks replaced classic ticket locks as the kernel's primary low-level spin lock mechanism in 2014, and
// ticket locks replaced test-and-set locks, which are unfair and allow unbounded bypass, in 2008 [13].

// The following is general and does not encode the flag field.
